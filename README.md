# Outline
Summary - For my final project, I would like to visualize annual fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions by country around the world. 

Audience - My data visualization is intended for viewers of any environmentally concious website. Showing how emissions have increased around the world over time will paint a vivid picture for any viewer that can be easily intepreted. Providing an interface that allows users to highlight and see specific numbers for any country at any time will make the visualization an effective tool for any viewer to use.

Timeline - My visualization will include highlighted information concerning major global events related to the increase in global fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. The older data points I am able to find will strengthen the visualization by showing the exponential increase in emissions over the last few decades.

Story - Fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions have drastically increased over the last few decades, resulting in significant global events. Understanding how individual countries, different regions, and the globe have increased emissions is critical to realizing the trend and path of emissions.

# Data
My primary data source is the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE). These sources are designed to provide long-term stewardship and use of data from observational, experimental, and modeling activities in the DOE in the Subsurface Biogeochemical Research (SBR) and Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Programs in the Environmental System Science (ESS) activity. 

The data source provides fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions information on all countries from the first year that the data was recorded through 2018. The values will be in metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted.

# Method & Medium
I intend to use shorthand as my primary story telling tool. Using the data provide by CDIAC/DOE, I'll create two visualizations. The first visualization will be a global heat map showing increases in fossil fuel emissions by country via a time lapse function. For the heat map, I plan to use a visualization mapping tool called Target Maps. The second visualization will be a line graph showing major regions, with the y-axis being the emissions values and the x-axis being the year. For this visualization, I plan on using datawrapper. On the line graph visualization, I will also highlight points at which there have been major global events related to fossil fuel emissions.
