# Outline
Summary - For my final project, I would like to visualize annual fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions by country around the world. 

Audience - My data visualization is intended for viewers of any environmentally concious website. Showing how emissions have increased around the world over time will paint a vivid picture for any viewer that can be easily intepreted. Providing an interface that allows users to highlight and see specific numbers for any country at any time will make the visualization an effective tool for any viewer to use.

Timeline - My visualization will include highlighted information concerning major global events related to the increase in global fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. The older data points I am able to find will strengthen the visualization by showing the exponential increase in emissions over the last few decades.

Story - Fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions have drastically increased over the last few decades, resulting in significant global events. Understanding how individual countries, different regions, and the globe have increased emissions is critical to realizing the trend and path of emissions.
